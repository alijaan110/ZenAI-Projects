5 stars,"My rating is based on food, service, and space. I did not order any drinks.

I ordered the bulgogi sandwich, the BELT sandwich, and a berry overnight oats for my partner and 3 year old to share. The sandwiches were delicious and flavorful! Bread was perfectly toasted, yet still fluffy. Good ratio of all ingredients. My 3 year old also loved the oats and the egg in the sandwiches. I may need to come back next time and see if I can just order an egg sandwich for the kids.

They have a self service kiosk so ordering was very easy. Menu has pictures and lists out all ingredients. The woman behind the counter was also incredibly sweet; she saw my 3 year old and asked me if he would like a chocolate wafer stick/straw on the house.

Space was open and clean. Went on a Saturday morning and they still had plenty of seating available.

We inhaled the food before I remembered to take pictures.",Tiffany Hsu,3 days ago

1 star,"Used to be good and pipping hot, today the bread was cold, the veggies and the egg all cold, no salt and pepper bland sandwich. Disappointed. Waste of money.",Shivani Jain Sharma,2 weeks ago
3 stars,"Super cute little spot in downtown Bellevue. The servers were super nice and the bingsoo was really good, too! But the sandwiches left a little to be wanted. Needs more flavor, more punch!",Mahak Mithani,4 weeks ago
2 stars,"Stopped in after a workout nearby based off an ad I saw on social media recently, and unfortunately fell into the “looks pretty, taste meh” category.

Nothing was wrong, everything was fine. I don’t want to spend 14$ for a “fine” sandwich and 12$ for a “fine” drink. I paid more for an extra shot of espresso, and it still tasted like milk. The BELT sandwich was okay, but for 14$ I do expect it to taste like more than just brioche bread. I tasted no bacon or tomatoes, the eggs were unseasoned, overall just ingredients hiding in fancy bread.

Staff were friendly and helpful, but it was all self service. If the prices drastically dropped I’d go back, but until then I’ll go literally anywhere else.",Sarah McGeehon,4 weeks ago

4 stars,"The coffee here is one of the better ones in the neighborhood. The sandwiches are pretty yummy, but every time I go, no matter what time of the day, the touch screens you order food from and the one you used to pay are filthy, like really gross. It’s always really discouraging.",Kevin Harper,a month ago

4 stars,"tucked into an apartment building by bellevue mall, semicolon cafe is a very minimalist and aesthetic cafe to go into. there was both a self order kiosk and register manned by an employee. i ordered the pistachio bomb latte, tiramisu latte, and the bulgogi sandwich. the prices were quite reasonable for the size of everything but was quite confused by the pistachio bomb latte as there was no espresso - turns out that the pistachio bomb has espresso and not what i ordered. the staff were very nice in explaining the difference and added the shots of espresso with no charge as well as a little sign stating their differences for the self order kiosk. the drinks were a bit on the sweeter side but still good and the sandwich was delectable! would definitely come again especially when you don't have to worry about parking :)",Anna Bui,2 months ago

3 stars,"We felt really comfortable in the place. The design is stylish and bright, which made for a nice atmosphere.

About the drinks - the matcha latte was tasty, but the milk flavor was quite strong. Since the portion was 16 oz, it kind of felt like buying a glass of green milk. There was an option on the menu to pay +$0.50 for less ice, but we still got the usual amount of ice.

We also added mascarpone cheese on top as a paid extra, but the drink came without it. When we mentioned it, the staff quickly fixed the issue, which was appreciated. Still, having two little mix-ups with just one customer (two drinks) and not even during a busy time feels a bit off.

On a positive note, my brother ordered a drink with the LOX sandwich - the sandwich looked great and really appetizing, and he enjoyed it a lot.

I was really drawn to this place by the Google reviews, but in practice, I’m not sure I’ll be coming back again.

Unfortunately, I didn’t take a photo😢",Maksym Khomich,2 months ago

4 stars,"Fluffy sandwich with good flavor. Just a headsup; if you’re in a hurry, you might want to skip it as the wait time can be a bit long. Also, the space is quite small compared to the crowd it draws so it can feel a little cramped during peak hours.",Primana,2 months ago

2 stars,"The bulgogi sandwich was quite disappointing. It didn't have much flavour, and was more like a western sandwich. The bread isn't like the typical fluffy bread you find in these Korean sandwiches, the lettuce felt out of place, and the sauce wasn't enough to save it. The portion size is avergae for these types of sandwiches, so not quite enough for a full lunch. Wouldn't come back for the sandwiches, but maybe the drinks are good!",Dylan Li,3 months ago

4 stars,"isited Semicolon Cafe recently and the place definitely has a nice vibe — cozy ambiance and aesthetically pleasing setup. We tried the chicken sandwich, egg sandwich, and a coffee. The presentation was great; everything looked really appetizing. However, the taste didn’t quite match the visual appeal. The sandwiches were decent but could’ve used a bit more flavor. Coffee was okay, not the best but not bad either. Overall, a decent spot to hang out, but there’s room for improvement on the taste side. Rating: 3.8/5.",Danish Vij,4 months ago

5 stars,"Came here for the first time and all I can say is WOW! I ordered the avocado sandwich and loved it.

The bread was light and fluffy and all of the ingredients inside worked together just right. Wish there was a little more sauce though (but still good). The sandwich was a little on the pricey side and kind of small for a full (it’s just right for a snack or light breakfast) meal but the quality and taste makes up for it.

The ambience is clean and calming, though there are limited seats as the cafe is quite small. However, I don’t think it’s an issue because it doesn’t seem too crowded.

Ordering is done through a kiosk and the food comes generally quickly. As for parking, I don’t think there’s much next to the cafe. I would recommend parking at the Bellevue square mall garage and then taking a short walk to the cafe, as it’s quite close.

Anyways, I will definitely be back to try more!",sandwich,5 months ago

3 stars,"We finally visited Semicolon Cafe—it had been getting quite a bit of hype, so I was curious to see what it was all about.

The space itself looks cute from far, and the concept seems promising, but the experience didn’t quite live up to the buzz. We arrived just a few minutes after opening on a weekend, and the staff already seemed a bit overwhelmed and confused, juggling multiple orders. Even though you order in a Tablet with no cashier interaction, it still took a while to get our coffee.
The ambience is very white, but the places is already showing the lack of cleaniless. Tables and chair chipped, looking dirty because it's all white.

Speaking of the coffee—it was just okay. Nothing memorable. Also, all the photos I had seen showed beautiful drinks in transparent cups, but ours came in basic paper cups, which was a bit of a letdown.

The sandwiches, unfortunately, were the biggest disappointment. They were kind of a mess—flavorless, overly drenched in mayo, and lacking everything.

Overall, it felt like one of those places that got popular on social media but doesn’t have much to offer beyond the aesthetic. Not terrible, just not worth the hype.",Denise Tanaka,5 months ago

1 star,"I recently visited this café and ordered a pistachio matcha with espresso. Honestly, the drink was average — nothing that really stood out.

What really frustrated me, though, were the extra charges. They charge 50 cents extra if you want light ice in your drink and another 50 cents if you choose fat-free milk. From a cost perspective, this makes no sense at all. It feels like they’re nickel-and-diming customers over basic customizations.

Also, if you’re doing self-checkout at their machine, be aware that they prompt you for a tip — even though you’re literally doing the checkout yourself. This is something that’s started happening at a few places lately, but it’s still frustrating and feels very off.

Overall, just be aware of all these extra charges before you go. Definitely not a place I would rush back to.",Sarthak Gupta,6 months ago

5 stars,"The sandwiches and drinks here are really good—I’ve never had authentic Gilgeori Toast, so I can’t speak to authenticity, but I loved the flavor. The cafe has seating, so you can sit and enjoy your food, but it’s not a cozy spot to linger for long. Parking can be tricky—you’ll need to park at the mall and walk about five minutes, as street parking is limited. Overall, it’s a hit, and I’d definitely come back!",Akanksha TG,7 months ago
5 stars,"About $10-13 for a small sandwich (that didn't fill me) but super delicious and fresh. My husband got a Bulgogi Sandwich and I got Shroom, both were real tasty.

On its own it's a good egg sandwich but what it's trying to be it's not wholly accurate to the thing in Korea.",Alan Wong,9 months ago
4 stars,"Semicolon Cafe in Bellevue is a delightful find, tucked away near the Safeway in Bellevue downtown. It’s a small spot, so it can be easy to miss while driving by. We usually park at Safeway and walk over, so I can’t comment on the availability of dedicated parking nearby.

The cafe is cozy but has limited seating, so it might be better suited for takeout during busy times. They offer a variety of options, including coffee, shaved ice, and their standout item: sandwiches. The menu leans heavily toward Asian-style sandwiches, though there are other choices as well.

My favorites are the Avocado and BELT sandwiches. The flavors are excellent, fresh, and thoughtfully crafted. However, the portions are a bit small for the price, so if you’re a big eater, consider ordering two to try different options. The coffee is decent—nothing extraordinary for me as I’m not a coffee enthusiast—but it pairs well with their food.

They also serve shaved ice, though I haven’t had a chance to try it yet.

Overall, Semicolon Cafe offers great food in a convenient location. While the prices reflect its downtown Bellevue setting, the quality and experience make it worth it. I highly recommend stopping by if you’re in the area and looking for a quick breakfast or brunch. They open at 8 AM, making it a perfect spot to grab something delicious before heading to work or during a break.",Hung Tran,10 months ago

1 star,"I was originally really excited to discover a new place in the neighborhood for breakfast and coffee. The sandwich looked ok but I found the coffee was sweetened. I politely told the lady (Asian lady in braids) that I was pre-diabetic and couldn't have this drink and expected to get offered to have the drink remade (as is usual at most places). Instead the lady with a sneer told me that it says the drinks have 2 pumps of syrup right on the menu. Looking around the store, I didn't see that mentioned anywhere so I asked to see the menu. She pulled out from under the counter, not a menu, but what was obviously a worksheet for employee use. After I pointed out that customers would not have access to this information when making their ordering decisions, she (with a really bad attitude) told me to dump my original drink and had a new one made. I don't know what level of service this lady is used to, but her attitude would not be acceptable anywhere and that especially doesn't fly in old Bellevue, Washington. I would give zero stars if I could.",Bing Wan,a year ago
4 stars,"This café is in the heart of Bellevue. The cafe oozes the morden and hip Korean cafe setting. Self-checkout and self-service. The sandwiches are delicious and loaded with fresh ingredients. The brioche bread is just as it should be. But the seating arrangement is the biggest turnoff for me. I am not sure whether it is a takeaway or a dine-in eatery. I understand the concept of a contemporary café, but if I'm paying around $50 for a meal for two, I would prefer a comfortable seating arrangement where individuals with long legs can fit. Very uncomfortable dining area. Aside from the set- up, the sandwiches are indulgent.",Nishita Rana,a year ago
2 stars,"I have been to both the Jersey City and Bellevue semi colon cafe multiple times now, and can say the Bellevue outlet is a let down in front of the Jersey City one.
The sandwiches are great, but the signature Tiramisu Latte is being destroyed here. They just put the ingredients in a cup and serve it to you. I am aghast with the way the servers here serve and treat the customers.
The choco stick and the flakes which should be on the top for the exquisite looks and flavour sometimes are just at the bottom of the drink all messed up.
I hope the owner gets on top of this particular outlet and gets the things in line as I really expected the Jersey City experience here in Bellevue.",SARTHAK AGRAWAL,a year ago

5 stars,"My partner and I visited for a late breakfast on a Saturday morning. I’d like to preface this by saying I usually don’t enjoy egg in general but the sandwiches looked so good I still wanted to try it and I’m so glad I did because the way they cook the egg is so light and fluffy it doesn’t have that rubber egg taste some dishes have. My partner had the Mango-ade which was refreshing and I had the Tiramisu Latte and it was so good I had to have another drink so I tried their limited Pistacho Bomb and it was really good too! Towards the end our meal an employee walked around giving samples of a drink to everyone sitting which was nice. Be prepared to take the food to go though because seating can fill up quickly, we asked for to go at first but luckily a table opened up while we waiting. Also they have their own promo code for parking on a board so don’t pay for the retail parking until you get inside!",Irene,a year ago
3 stars,"Very cute sandwich shop with a hip but modern atmosphere. The placement of the shop is perfect because it’s on the corner of a popular street in Bellevue and you can come here and grab a snack then head to the park across the street. The food was decent, but the sandwich started to fall apart easily. Personally there was too much sauce on mine and made the bread soggy. Smoothies were good and refreshing. The pricing was pushing it, and definitely think they should be lowered based on the quality of the sandwiches. I just don’t think you should be charging up to $30 for bread, meat, and mystery sauce lol. The employees seemed nice, but with self check out being popular you don’t really interact with people behind a register nowadays, a bit sad and less personal. Will i go back? Maybe.",Lilypad,a year ago

2 stars,"Hipster Asian fusion sandwich place that I had been on list to try and finally got to go.  This is definitely a place to try but would not be a go-to place if I was in the area.

Parking: Shared retail parking for the building
Pet friendly: Yes – I would have assumed no since the café is super tiny without an outdoor seating but there was a dog the day I went.
Family friendly: Yes if your child can sit on a backless stool without you worry they will fall off LOL

FOOD:
Overall: Go in knowing that there is a base for the sandwiches meaning all of them have scrambled eggs with grilled corn and lettuce in between toasted brioche bread.  This is my personal preference but I’m not a fan of brioche… its fluffy but its “too fluffy” that there isn’t a good density that holds everything in the sandwich.  No matter what I’ve had between brioche, it always always always falls apart.  The eggs did not have any taste to it… like it needed just basic salt and pepper.  I also didn’t taste any corn.  If I didn’t read corn in the menu description, I wouldn’t have thought there was any.

1. S.O.S Sandwich (base, tomato, red cabbage, cheddar cheese, Kiwi sauce, mayonnaise) $9.49: 2 Stars - I know some people are adverse to mayo but I love it.  But literally all I taste is mayo.
2. Chicken Sandwich (base, spicy chicken, red onion, jalapeno, mozzarella cheese, spicy sauce) $11.49: 2 Stars - Not spicy at all and the flavor was just okay.  I love spicy and there was barely a kick.
3. Lox Sandwich (base, Arugula, smoked salmon, red onion, yogurt dill sauce) $12.49: 3 Stars - I understand the sandwich is small but I feel like they skimped on the filling.  The ratio was off – meager amount of smoked salmon (like one slice/piece) to sauce.  All I could taste was mushy-non-corn-tasting-eggs and dill sauce.
4. Bulgogi Sandwich (base, tomato, marinated beef bulgogi, red onions, Bulgogi sauce) $11.99: 2 Stars - Bulgogi has a distinct flavor that I did not get here.  The one good thing I can say about this sandwich is there was at least a textural difference with it being a beef sandwich.

MENU/RESTAURANT:
When I walked in I actually thought this place was a walk up and order place only because of how uber small it was.  My plan was a quick sit down lunch with my family but we had to do take out as there was no way my 2 year old son could stably sit down on the modern cubes they had for most of their seating.   The loved the décor inside - very clean, simple, modern, and black and white.

I like the idea of the menu - small, streamline, and focused on a few things.  What is better than a pretty sandwich? I love carbs so anything in sandwich form is great.

SERVICE:
Meh.  You order from a tablet so you don’t actually have much interaction with anyone.  I saw a few folks behind the counter but no one that made eye contact or spoke to me until they called out my number… the girl just said the number, pushed out my bag, and didn’t really say anything else.",Linda Chong,a year ago
5 stars,"This was, singlehandedly, the BEST breakfast sandwich I have ever had. Yes, even better than most sit-down restaurants!

It’s a welcoming, well-decorated space that has clear pictures and pricing for their food and drinks, and even offers both wifi and parking recommendations with their own promo code! The space is set up very well for handling queues and giving folks space to sit and chat. Their drink and food options looked both tasty and pretty, and I appreciated the variety of flavor options they offer!
I did not try their drinks, but I was happy to see they offered different degrees of sweetness and caffeine for their lattes and espresso drinks. Whether you love a strong espresso flavor or “dessert in a cup” sweetness, this place has you covered! There’s also a small fridge that includes some canned drink options, along with some other sweet dessert/food options.

I ordered via a single machine at the front, which gives you a clear picture of the menu options and provides a HUGE level of customization! (Side note: if you get anxious about talking to folks when ordering, this place is a great option for you!) I ended up doing an add-on of bacon to my avocado sandwich, and saw a ton of different options for other ways to customize. I noticed a number of orders packaged up and waiting, so it looks like you also have the option to order ahead or order through a meal delivery app for this place!
Wait time was very minimal—it took about 5 minutes between me placing my order and hearing my number called out.

The sandwich here felt like everything I’d ever want and more! The brioche bread is crispy on the outside but fluffy and buttery and toasted in the center, and the korean-inspired sauce they used was a perfect blend of spicy and savory! I felt like I got a satisfying amount of each ingredient for the price point, and I loved the fact that this sandwich wasn’t super messy! It’s incredibly rare to find a well-stuffed breakfast sandwich that doesn’t fall apart or make a mess, but they found a way to do it!
Major props to the simple and cute presentation of my to-go order, it felt cute and charming, while also being super helpful for on-the-go travel!

I absolutely loved it! I’m excited to return (especially with friends) and can easily see myself spending a morning here, or grabbing a sandwich for lunch to take to the park (which is literally just one block down the street)!",Isabel Milano,a year ago

1 star,"I was here april 18th at 9am, the worker here is quite disrespectful. I came to get some coffee and a sandwich! When we arrived, the girl who worked there did not even greet us. Didn't say hello or anything! I would get it if it were busy, but it wasn't since it's literally a Thursday morning. I had a question regarding one of the beverages there and wanted to ask her, but she gave me an attitude and behaved as if I was oblivious or something! When she handed me my food, she didn't say anything, just left it there, and when I came up, she just slid the food to me again without saying anything. I saw she was constantly on her phone! Honestly, the service here is terrible! Listen to the other reviews; don't come here expecting nice service because it was really horrible! The sandwich was good, but I would not return here for the service!",zo,a year ago

1 star,"I've been here several times, coffee drinks barely have any coffee in it. Mocha is pretty much chocolate milk. It's odd. Such a cute ambience but the drinks just don't cut out. I've gotten their iced matcha drinks and it's very watery tasting.

I've ordered and had to wait to call someone out of the kitchen after 5 minutes. No other person waiting or orders being made. Not sure what the deal is, just very unusual. I've come in multiple times just to see if I can be proven wrong but it's seems to be consistently inconsistent here. They don't really pay attention to quality in drinks here or customer service

I don't recommend.",Philicia Saephan,Edited a year ago
1 star,"Tables too short for the seating, incredibly uncomfortable. No plugs for laptops, and while they clearly tried to make it look 'trendy' the execution is truly terrible. Cups are so cheap, the lids just collapse if you try to open the sip hole on them.

1 star,"I have wanted to try this establishment for a while. However they may have incorrect information concerning their hours. We arrived at 4:30pm on a Saturday hoping to get a quick bite but were told that 'The kitchen is closed' and were refused service. If the main part of the business (cafe) stops operating at 4:30pm then that would be expected to be the closing time and not 5pm as stated on their window and online. With that you never know when they will decide that they are not making food, which shouldn't even take long since they are sandwiches and/or shaved ice. Professional businesses do not do this.",Katie,a year ago

If you want a very clean and fresh perfect breakfast sandwich, I highly recommend this place! Everything is so fresh that’s in the sandwich. The bread is amazing. The eggs are perfectly fluffy and the mustard mayo is beyond… I also decided to get the Matcha espresso iced drink instead of milk I got almond milk… Again the best drink I’ve had in a very, very long time.

2 stars,"I don’t normally write reviews but this place was so bad in service I had to share my experience.

First of all all of the workers there seemed so sad like they didn’t even want to be there. I would understand if they worked long hours and I judge on that. These workers don’t repeat your order back at all, I repeated twice that i wanted a Chai latte and even my boyfriend next to me heard but they just gave me a regular latte instead. When i confronted them about the mistake they just accused me saying that i said latte, not a chai latte. I was really upset and i’m not a confrontational person so it really hurt me and i just left it be. My boyfriend right after agreed with me that the workers there seemed like they hate us, it’s not a welcoming environment.

Food was ok, I would of given them another chance if i lived locally but if you live in a different city save your gas it’s not worth the drive…",Celeste Leija Medellin,a year ago

2 stars,"This is our second time visiting this city. The first time we came, this shop had just opened, but unfortunately, I didn't have time to check it out. This time, we came specifically to try the sandwiches recommended by many foodies.  The interior design of this store was simple and natural, especially with many plants ,creating a comfortable atmosphere. However, when I was about to take a photo, a female employee behind the counter said, 'Can I help you?' I turned to look at her, and she had a frowning, unhappy expression. I really don't know what was wrong with her.

To place an order, there was a large electronic screen to select the  items. We ordered the Lox smoked salmon and Shroom  portabella mushroom sandwiches for takeout. The food was served quite quickly, and we went to a nearby park for a picnic. The mushroom and egg had a nice texture, but the sauce and bread  all had a slightly sweet taste, which I didn't particularly like. Overall, it's not worth coming here specifically to try.",candy L,2 years ago

1 star,"Food is okay. But the self service kiosk automatically charges 18% of tip!!! While this is fully self-service. Watch out for that.

Edit:
The business replied saying that the custom “can” choose their tip % in the payment page. This is true, but there is a huge difference between a user ‘can’ navigate to some pages to choose % tip but that’s not really obvious if you use it the first time and if you fail to do that it charges 18% tip, like this case, or make the tip choice in an obvious way during payment.

Again the fact that they have the audacity to ask for tip and telling me I ‘can’ opt out of tip while this is 100% self service is disgusting.",L Chen,Edited 2 years ago
2 stars,"This is not really representative of a Korean sandwich shop (it feels sort of like they tried to copy it but something is missing). The bulgogi sandwich is the most decent.

I  ordered the SOS sandwich one time and they left out a lot of ingredients: the scrambled eggs with corn that was supposed to be in the sandwich, skimpy on the tomato, and they forgot to add the ham that I had paid for as extra. I called to let them know and they said they’d refund me for the sandwich but I’d probably won’t order other sandwiches from here again.

The place is also not the cleanest. You have to buss after previous customers because they don’t really wipe the tables after each customer leaves.",Christine,2 years ago
1 star,"I came to this place looking for a place to sit down and do some work while eating some breakfast. I walked in and the place was empty and the girl working didn't acknowledge me at all. Instead of taking my order, there was a huge tablet in front of the counter that you placed your order on. You're prompted to leave a tip even though you've had zero interaction with the people working, not even a hello.
I was the only customer in there. The music was incredibly loud. I went to the bathroom while waiting for my food. While I was in the bathroom, the girl started yelling ""order for one!"" over and over and over. Like settle down girl. I'm washing my hands and there's literally no one else in here. So anyway, I go to the counter and ask for a to-go cup with water and it was clear she didn't want to give it to me but she did it begrudgingly. I ended up leaving with my food and drinks because the whole vibe was off and the girl was super rude.

When we arrived around noon, the restaurant was quite busy with no seating available. We ordered via the kiosk and had the option to customize our order (ex. change sauces). After about 15 mins, we got our food - an avocado sandwich for myself and a mushroom sandwich for my friend. I enjoyed my food - the avocado was creamy, the egg was cooked well and I especially liked the brioche bread and its buttery and light taste. The only drawback is the cost - $10 for a simple sandwich seems a little pricey to me.",Priyanka D.,2 years ago

4 stars,"We stopped at Semicolon Cafe in Bellevue for a quick and tasty lunch on a short 2 night getaway that we made to the Seattle/Bellevue area.They serve some really tasty Korean Egg Drop sandwiches as well as a variety of refreshing drinks, macarons, pudding, and bingsoo. Korean Egg Drop sandwiches consist of thick slices of Brioche bread stuffed with fluffy scrambled eggs and a variety of other fillings. (I couldn't actually find the words Egg Drop Sandwich anywhere on their menu or their website, but they serve Bingsoo which is a Korean dessert and their sandwiches match all the pictures and descriptions of Egg Drop Sandwiches that pop up if I search for ""Egg Drop Sandwiches"" on Google. So, I'm very sure that's what they're serving!)

There's a rectangular screen set up where you can place your order electronically. We ordered:

Brewed Coffee
Caramel Latte
Lady Matcha
Chicken Sandwich
Avocado Sandwich

Our first time eating Korean Egg Drop sandwiches and this was a marvelous introduction to it. Usually our picky eater isn't a fan of egg. Faced with these sandwiches she was a bit apprehensive at first. After eating these sandwiches though, she loved them so much that she asked if we could eat there again on the way home!

Their drinks were wonderful as well, and it's got a very aesthetic feel to it. Highly recommend this place!

The cafe can be busy, so it's not always guaranteed to find seating. The acoustics of the interior make it noisier than most places.

One of the sandwiches was good, the other one was mediocre, I could barely eat it so I bought another one thinking a third option would turn out better.

1 star,"Don't go this place. I ordered a smoothie and a sandwich. The smoothie was ready in 5 minutes, but the servers never call my name for another 5 minutes. It was 9:20am of Saturday, there were not many people around there, and my order was number 6, but their serving is soooo slow. I was thinking that they will call me when the sandwich is ready, but it is not. They called my name just for smoothie after it was ready for 5 minutes. Later, I got the sandwich (20min later although there was not that many orders were placed), it was cold and not fresh at all. I ordered bulgogi sandwich, and it was a cold sandwich, seems like they prepared it a long time ago and made sandwich after I complained about why the sandwich is not coming. The best part was the reaction of the server (lady with long hair). She keep mentioning ""sorry, do you want refund""? ""We will apply your feedback"", but the attitude was to just let me shut up and go. Another funny moment was that she went inside the kitchen and yelled to the workers (making sandwiches) that why she need to here complain from me, and everything was the sandwich maker's fault, and I can hear that all very well at the table. Avoid this place if you don't like a cold sandwich nor slow serving.",Yeongjin Jang,2 years ago

5 stars,"Ordered a spicy chicken sandwich to go. Overall it’s pretty good, love the spicy sauce, not spicy but flavorful, the egg is super soft and perfect. The only thing is I paid $12 for a sandwich but it doesn’t fulfill.

Update: We went to this spot again for breakfast and dine in this time. Staffs are friendly and the store is very cozy, clean and very instagramable! I really appreciate that they allow dogs inside. It’s an amazing dining experience here! Will recommend dining in to enjoy the food and the space if you can!",Ming Lee,Edited 2 years ago

Everything exceeded our expectations.",Brandon Wichman,2 years ago

5 stars,"Ordered a tiramisu latte and a Bulgogi sandwich. Sooo good and filling. I've been here a few times and really enjoy their matcha, bingsoo and sandwiches! What pushed me to write a review this time is the customer service. The lady at the counter seemed curt, and when I realized I had ordered wrongly an iced coffee instead of hot, and the receipt shows this, she offered to remake it hot (albeit curtly), so not wanting to make it worse I said nonono it's ok. But when my sandwich came out she had already remade the drink hot anyway and offered it to me all matter of fact. Actions speak louder than words. Made my morning, even though it was my mistake to start! 🙏",Ya-Wei Wang,2 years ago
