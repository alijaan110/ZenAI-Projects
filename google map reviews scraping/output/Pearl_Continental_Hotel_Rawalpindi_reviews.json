Service wise I have no comments and hesitations to recommend the stay in hotel , except the sitting area outside the hotel lobby , the mosquitos were so much that they made it difficult to sit there, I would request the hotel managed to kindly make necessary arrangements to get rid of mosquitoes , I visited this hotel to meet my cousin jaleel Khan who came from America and was staying in this hotel , it was 21st of October at around 6.0 pm",

They only talk to you nicely if you dress to impress, actually think they are something special because they work for a mediocre hotel they thing is massive, maybe is for Pakistan!\n\nSo we arrived and requested a taxi to go darbar they told us all the roads were closed it was a no go area. We walked out and easily found a rickshaw that took us straight there.\n\nThen I happen to forget my laptop in the room! I flew out to London.\n\nOnce they found it, because i couldnt remember the room the staff were being funny needlessley! I then requested it be sent to london I will pay the cost , given we are in the 21st centrury, surely this is not too much to ask.\n\nI was shocked to find out this was against their policy, they were so unhelpful. I raised a complaint they said they would contact me back via wattapp after they have spoken to managemnt. A whole day passed no one contacted me, so I called back to find out no progress had been made. The guy assured me he would contact me via wattapp and did not. After constant chasing i gave up.\n\nI arranged for my uncle to to PC hotel to pick up the laptop he travelled 3 hours to get there, the staff were rude to him and made him wait 2 hours. Made no contact with me, for one hour whilst he was there and told him to just wait. Once they did we arranged for the laptop to handed over but that toom another hour!\n\nWho do these people think they are, avoid this hotel!\n\nManagement, this is a reflection of you, your team member gave poor service, when someone is stuck like that any other hotel in this 21st century would go out of their way to help, let alone the attidude of your staff, how dare you make my uncle wait 2 hours with such awful attidude!!!\n\nAvoid this hotel at all cost!",
