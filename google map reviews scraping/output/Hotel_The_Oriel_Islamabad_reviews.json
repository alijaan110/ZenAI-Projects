Additionally, if you request the air conditioning to be turned on, they charge an extra 2000. On the hotel’s website, the room price is listed less than 3000, but they demand 3500 and then reduce it to 3000. I'm not satisfied 😔",

They  made me feel like a valued guest, not just a room number. This level of personalized service is rare. Whether you're a local guest or traveling from abroad, you'll find a genuine sense of warmth here.\nIf you're looking for a hotel that offers more than just a place to sleep , the Oriel Hotel is an excellent choice. The 'family-like behavior' of the staff makes it a standout experience.specially I would suggest to female to stay here without any worries ,I would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a comfortable and welcoming stay.\"",

The location isn't ideal, as it's situated near car workshops, which can be noisy and inconvenient. The ambiance of the hotel felt quite basic and lacked charm. Additionally, the blanket in the room had visible stains, which was off-putting. The washroom had a strong, unpleasant odor that made it uncomfortable to use. Overall, the stay did not meet my expectations",
