When I got to the reception desk, they informed me that they don’t accommodate foreigners and that my booking never existed. Being rejected at the reception desk like this was infuriating. If you don’t accept foreigners, don’t list your property on platforms like Agoda or Booking.com, or at the very least, clearly state it in the description in capital letters.\n\nThis was a deeply frustrating and disappointing experience, especially after a long journey. Not the welcome I expected for my trip to Islamabad, and it left a bad first impression. Such poor communication and service.",
