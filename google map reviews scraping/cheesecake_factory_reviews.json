We tried the chicken sandwich, egg sandwich, and a coffee. The presentation was great; everything looked really appetizing. However, the taste didn’t quite match the visual appeal. The sandwiches were decent but could’ve used a bit more flavor. Coffee was okay, not the best but not bad either. Overall, a decent spot to hang out, but there’s room for improvement on the taste side. Rating: 3.8/5.",

I ordered the avocado sandwich and loved it.\n\nThe bread was light and fluffy and all of the ingredients inside worked together just right. Wish there was a little more sauce though (but still good). The sandwich was a little on the pricey side and kind of small for a full (it’s just right for a snack or light breakfast) meal but the quality and taste makes up for it.\n\nThe ambience is clean and calming, though there are limited seats as the cafe is quite small. However, I don’t think it’s an issue because it doesn’t seem too crowded.\n\nOrdering is done through a kiosk and the food comes generally quickly. As for parking, I don’t think there’s much next to the cafe. I would recommend parking at the Bellevue square mall garage and then taking a short walk to the cafe, as it’s quite close.\n\nAnyways, I will definitely be back to try more!",

This is definitely a place to try but would not be a go-to place if I was in the area.\n\nParking: Shared retail parking for the building\nPet friendly: Yes – I would have assumed no since the café is super tiny without an outdoor seating but there was a dog the day I went.\nFamily friendly: Yes if your child can sit on a backless stool without you worry they will fall off LOL\n\nFOOD:\nOverall: Go in knowing that there is a base for the sandwiches meaning all of them have scrambled eggs with grilled corn and lettuce in between toasted brioche bread.  This is my personal preference but I’m not a fan of brioche… its fluffy but its “too fluffy” that there isn’t a good density that holds everything in the sandwich.  No matter what I’ve had between brioche, it always always always falls apart.  The eggs did not have any taste to it… like it needed just basic salt and pepper.  I also didn’t taste any corn.  If I didn’t read corn in the menu description, I wouldn’t have thought there was any.\n\n1. S.O.S Sandwich (base, tomato, red cabbage, cheddar cheese, Kiwi sauce, mayonnaise) $9.49: 2 Stars - I know some people are adverse to mayo but I love it.  But literally all I taste is mayo.\n2. Chicken Sandwich (base, spicy chicken, red onion, jalapeno, mozzarella cheese, spicy sauce) $11.49: 2 Stars - Not spicy at all and the flavor was just okay.  I love spicy and there was barely a kick.\n3. Lox Sandwich (base, Arugula, smoked salmon, red onion, yogurt dill sauce) $12.49: 3 Stars - I understand the sandwich is small but I feel like they skimped on the filling.  The ratio was off – meager amount of smoked salmon (like one slice/piece) to sauce.  All I could taste was mushy-non-corn-tasting-eggs and dill sauce.\n4. Bulgogi Sandwich (base, tomato, marinated beef bulgogi, red onions, Bulgogi sauce) $11.99: 2 Stars - Bulgogi has a distinct flavor that I did not get here.  The one good thing I can say about this sandwich is there was at least a textural difference with it being a beef sandwich.\n\nMENU/RESTAURANT:\nWhen I walked in I actually thought this place was a walk up and order place only because of how uber small it was.  My plan was a quick sit down lunch with my family but we had to do take out as there was no way my 2 year old son could stably sit down on the modern cubes they had for most of their seating.   The loved the décor inside - very clean, simple, modern, and black and white.\n\nI like the idea of the menu - small, streamline, and focused on a few things.  What is better than a pretty sandwich? I love carbs so anything in sandwich form is great.\n\nSERVICE:\nMeh.  You order from a tablet so you don’t actually have much interaction with anyone.  I saw a few folks behind the counter but no one that made eye contact or spoke to me until they called out my number… the girl just said the number, pushed out my bag, and didn’t really say anything else.",

My plan was a quick sit down lunch with my family but we had to do take out as there was no way my 2 year old son could stably sit down on the modern cubes they had for most of their seating.   The loved the décor inside - very clean, simple, modern, and black and white.\n\nI like the idea of the menu - small, streamline, and focused on a few things.  What is better than a pretty sandwich? I love carbs so anything in sandwich form is great.\n\nSERVICE:\nMeh.  You order from a tablet so you don’t actually have much interaction with anyone.  I saw a few folks behind the counter but no one that made eye contact or spoke to me until they called out my number… the girl just said the number, pushed out my bag, and didn’t really say anything else.",

        "review_text": "Semicolon Cafe in Bellevue is a delightful find, tucked away near the Safeway in Bellevue downtown. It’s a small spot, so it can be easy to miss while driving by. We usually park at Safeway and walk over, so I can’t comment on the availability of dedicated parking nearby.\n\nThe cafe is cozy but has limited seating, so it might be better suited for takeout during busy times. They offer a variety of options, including coffee, shaved ice, and their standout item: sandwiches. The menu leans heavily toward Asian-style sandwiches, though there are other choices as well.\n\nMy favorites are the Avocado and BELT sandwiches. The flavors are excellent, fresh, and thoughtfully crafted. However, the portions are a bit small for the price, so if you’re a big eater, consider ordering two to try different options. The coffee is decent—nothing extraordinary for me as I’m not a coffee enthusiast—but it pairs well with their food.\n\nThey also serve shaved ice, though I haven’t had a chance to try it yet.\n\nOverall, Semicolon Cafe offers great food in a convenient location. While the prices reflect its downtown Bellevue setting, the quality and experience make it worth it. I highly recommend stopping by if you’re in the area and looking for a quick breakfast or brunch. They open at 8 AM, making it a perfect spot to grab something delicious before heading to work or during a break.",

        "review_text": "This was, singlehandedly, the BEST breakfast sandwich I have ever had. Yes, even better than most sit-down restaurants!\n\nSemicolon feels like a place that has their customer top-of-mind. It’s a welcoming, well-decorated space that has clear pictures and pricing for their food and drinks, and even offers both wifi and parking recommendations with their own promo code! The space is set up very well for handling queues and giving folks space to sit and chat. Their drink and food options looked both tasty and pretty, and I appreciated the variety of flavor options they offer!\nI did not try their drinks, but I was happy to see they offered different degrees of sweetness and caffeine for their lattes and espresso drinks. Whether you love a strong espresso flavor or “dessert in a cup” sweetness, this place has you covered! There’s also a small fridge that includes some canned drink options, along with some other sweet dessert/food options.\n\nI ordered via a single machine at the front, which gives you a clear picture of the menu options and provides a HUGE level of customization! (Side note: if you get anxious about talking to folks when ordering, this place is a great option for you!) I ended up doing an add-on of bacon to my avocado sandwich, and saw a ton of different options for other ways to customize. I noticed a number of orders packaged up and waiting, so it looks like you also have the option to order ahead or order through a meal delivery app for this place!\nWait time was very minimal—it took about 5 minutes between me placing my order and hearing my number called out.\n\nThe sandwich here felt like everything I’d ever want and more! The brioche bread is crispy on the outside but fluffy and buttery and toasted in the center, and the korean-inspired sauce they used was a perfect blend of spicy and savory! I felt like I got a satisfying amount of each ingredient for the price point, and I loved the fact that this sandwich wasn’t super messy! It’s incredibly rare to find a well-stuffed breakfast sandwich that doesn’t fall apart or make a mess, but they found a way to do it!\nMajor props to the simple and cute presentation of my to-go order, it felt cute and charming, while also being super helpful for on-the-go travel!\n\nI absolutely loved it! I’m excited to return (especially with friends) and can easily see myself spending a morning here, or grabbing a sandwich for lunch to take to the park (which is literally just one block down the street)!",

The placement of the shop is perfect because it’s on the corner of a popular street in Bellevue and you can come here and grab a snack then head to the park across the street.

The pricing was pushing it, and definitely think they should be lowered based on the quality of the sandwiches. I just don’t think you should be charging up to $30 for bread, meat, and mystery sauce lol. The employees seemed nice, but with self check out being popular you don’t really interact with people behind a register nowadays, a bit sad and less personal. Will i go back? Maybe.",

Luckily we got there before a huge crowd came and was able to find a small table.\n\nThe latte was sweet and flavorful (which I like) though some people may find it too sweet. The bulgogi sandwich was tasty & filling. I loved the mayo topping and thought the meat’s texture was perfect, though I wished it had a bit more flavor.\n\nIn terms of ambience, the Korean aesthetic is so on point with beautiful white tile, marble tables, and so many plants! Overall nice spot to visit for lunch, though I’d avoid going during regular lunch hours if you’re in a rush. It’s a small spot and our food took a while to get to our table.",

Luckily we got there before a huge crowd came and was able to find a small table.\n\nThe latte was sweet and flavorful (which I like) though some people may find it too sweet. The bulgogi sandwich was tasty & filling. I loved the mayo topping and thought the meat’s texture was perfect, though I wished it had a bit more flavor.\n\nIn terms of ambience, the Korean aesthetic is so on point with beautiful white tile, marble tables, and so many plants! Overall nice spot to visit for lunch, though I’d avoid going during regular lunch hours if you’re in a rush. It’s a small spot and our food took a while to get to our table.",

My sandwich had a truffle sauce that was creamy and savory, but I wish the actual mushrooms and scrambled eggs were hot. The bread was toasted and warm but nothing else was which was kinda disappointing but atleast the flavors were good and the sandwich was filling.",

It had a subtle truffle flavor and tasted somewhat like caesar salad dressing. The egg could be more custard-like honestly. The bulgogi was standard. A little chewy and a bit cold... but still flavorful! Overall, a decent sando and a very aesthetic cafe. They also validate parking for two hours.",

(I couldn't actually find the words Egg Drop Sandwich anywhere on their menu or their website, but they serve Bingsoo which is a Korean dessert and their sandwiches match all the pictures and descriptions of Egg Drop Sandwiches that pop up if I search for \"Egg Drop Sandwiches\" on Google. So, I'm very sure that's what they're serving!)\n\nThere's a rectangular screen set up where you can place your order electronically. We ordered:\n\nBrewed Coffee\nCaramel Latte\nLady Matcha\nChicken Sandwich\nAvocado Sandwich\n\nOur first time eating Korean Egg Drop sandwiches and this was a marvelous introduction to it. Usually our picky eater isn't a fan of egg. Faced with these sandwiches she was a bit apprehensive at first.

The interior is small with limited seating but is nicely decorated with lush greenery. When we arrived around noon, the restaurant was quite busy with no seating available. We ordered via the kiosk and had the option to customize our order (ex. change sauces). After about 15 mins, we got our food - an avocado sandwich for myself and a mushroom sandwich for my friend. I enjoyed my food - the avocado was creamy, the egg was cooked well and I especially liked the brioche bread and its buttery and light taste. The only drawback is the cost - $10 for a simple sandwich seems a little pricey to me.",

        "review_text": "My girlfriend and I recently visited this cafe and tried the Lox sandwich, the bulgogi sandwich and the pistachio latte – honestly, it was the best taste we’ve ever had! Incredible combination of ingredients, and the sauce was just fantastic. We’ll definitely be coming back. By the way, due to my own oversight, I paid for parking first and only then noticed they offer a free parking coupon. Now we know! 🥸",

You can park at the garage (entrance next to the store) but will need to use the promo code (which you get from the store) when you pay your parking through LAZ parking app - the promo code is for 2 hours free parking.",

Service is quite quick . Limited menu but very exciting sandwich options and fruit drink choices . Seating is little uncomfortable for as it is wooden chairs . Avacado Sandwich is too good . Very berry drink is also good . Prices are very reasonable.",

        "review_text": "Semicolon is a lovely cafe in Downtown Bellevue, bright and modern. It has wall windows, stylish tables and stools, lively houseplants above an Asian style curtain door for the kitchen behind the counter. I got there on a weekday morning shortly after they open, so I was the only one there.\n\nMy latte was good, and my jaw dropped when I got the breakfast sandwich. It's a thing of beauty, almost too pretty to be consumed. When I did make up my mind to \"destroy\" the beauty and taste it, I didn't regret at all. The bulgogi beef is well marinated and flavorful, the veggie is fresh and the special sauce is creamy. It was the best breakfast sandwich I had in a long time.\n\nI returned a few days later with high expectations, only to get a little disappointed this time. The Tiramisu Latte didn't stand out and the bacon breakfast sandwich wasn't as gorgeous as the one I'd been craving in my head over and over even since that first visit. I went back yet another time on a Sunday and the cafe was packed with an \"Instagram crowd\"–if you know what I mean. The whole vibe was quite different from the way I liked it, so I left without getting anything.\n\nI still fancy Semicolon's breakfast sandwich, and I'd love to get another latte from Adam, the barista from my first visit. But I have more realistic expectations now, and for sure I'll avoid lunch time especially on a weekend.",

How can this place ask for a tip if there is no interaction at all with anyone up front? I don’t understand. They could at least greet the costumers I did leave tip anyhow. One of the sandwiches was good, the other one was mediocre, I could barely eat it so I bought another one thinking a third option would turn out better. It was NOT the case and I was so disappointed to have spent $50 dollars on 3 small sandwiches and 2 drinks. Never coming back here again.
